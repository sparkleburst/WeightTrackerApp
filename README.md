# WeightTrackerApp
July 2024 Update
The weight-tracking app is running very well. 

A TODO project to complete

This app was designed to help anyone keep track of their weight and to be able to compare it to a goal weight.
The screens so far are signup, login, add goal weight, add daily weight, and results. The user is asked for permission to allow notifications so the user can be notified when they have reached the goal weight.
The UI design keeps the intentions clear, It is simple and only asks for the information needed.
I tested to ensure the code was functional by running the app and as I encountered challenges I looked at logcat to see when bugs occurred and this helped in figuring out how to fix them.
