        <center><h4>Professional Self-Assessment</h4></center> 
       
<p>Throughout my Computer Science program, developing and enhancing the weight tracker app has been a cornerstone of my learning experience. This project has allowed me to showcase my strengths, shape my professional goals and values, and prepare for a career in the computer science field. Completing my coursework and developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in this journey.</p>

<h5>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h5>

<p>Although the weight tracker app was primarily an individual project, the collaborative skills I honed in team settings during other coursework were invaluable. In group projects, such as the Collaboration and Team Project course, I learned the importance of effective communication, coordination, and collaborative problem-solving. These experiences taught me how to navigate different working styles and contribute meaningfully to achieve common goals, skills that were essential when seeking feedback and making iterative improvements to my app.</p>

<h5>Communicating with Stakeholders:</h5>

<p>Effective communication with stakeholders has been a critical part of my development process. Regular updates and presentations to instructors and peers during my capstone project honed my ability to articulate complex technical details in an accessible manner. Explaining the enhancements and technical choices for the weight tracker app, such as the adoption of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, strengthened my capacity to convey intricate concepts clearly and concisely, an essential skill when discussing project requirements or presenting solutions to clients and team members.</p>

<h5>Data Structures and Algorithms</h5>

<p>Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental to computer science, and this knowledge was pivotal in enhancing the weight tracker app. For instance, implementing efficient data retrieval methods and optimizing the database schema to handle user data demonstrated my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of computational efficiency. These improvements ensured the app could handle multiple user entries and display data without performance issues.</p>

<h5>Software Engineering and Database</h5>

<p>My coursework provided extensive knowledge in software engineering principles and database management, directly applicable to the weight tracker app. Designing the SQLite database schema to efficiently store user data, including weight records and login credentials, showcased my ability to develop robust backend solutions. Implementing CRUD operations and optimizing database queries with indexing and pagination were particularly valuable lessons in improving app performance and scalability.</p>

<h5>Security</h5>

<p>Security is a crucial aspect of software development, and I applied this knowledge to the weight tracker app by implementing secure authentication and data validation measures. Enhancing the password and email validation algorithms to ensure data integrity and security demonstrated my commitment to protecting user information. This focus on security reflects my understanding of cybersecurity protocols and best practices, which are essential in building reliable and trustworthy applications.</p>

<h5>Summary of Technical Artifacts</h5>

<p>The weight tracker app included in my ePortfolio demonstrates the breadth and depth of my skills and knowledge. This project highlights my proficiency in mobile app development, database management, user interface design, and security. By integrating enhancements such as the MVVM design pattern, pagination for efficient data display, and robust error handling mechanisms, the app showcases my ability to create practical, real-world applications.</p>

<p>Bringing these elements together, my ePortfolio provides a comprehensive overview of my computer science talents and abilities. It reflects my journey through the program, the challenges I have overcome, and the skills I have acquired. I am confident that this portfolio not only demonstrates my technical expertise but also my readiness to contribute effectively in a professional setting.</p>
